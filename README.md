Bing AutoSuggest-API

Bing AutoSuggest:

Bing Autosuggest API v7, help users complete queries faster by adding intelligent type-ahead capabilities to your app or website. 
Empower users to type less and do more with automated and complete search suggestions. With the API v7, 
discover improved error handling capabilities to troubleshoot and diagnose problems quickly.

Implementation of Azure Bing AutoSuggest using local API:

Steps to retrieve the results of the API are as below:

Step 1:
Click on the URL http://165.227.109.228:3000/api-docs/#/ 

This URL consists of the swagger implementation of the application
